# This is Grid-Template
## Gulp Integration
### The template was created with Gulp, a task runner used for automating various build tasks. Below are some of the main tasks and how they are used within the development workflow:

### Gulp Tasks:

`CSS Preprocessing:`

`SASS or LESS can be used for advanced CSS features. Gulp automates the compilation of these preprocessors into plain CSS.`

### Minification:

`Gulp minifies CSS and JavaScript files to reduce file sizes for production deployment.`

### Live Reloading:

`Gulp automatically reloads the browser whenever a change is made to HTML, CSS, or JS files, which is useful during development.`

### BrowserSync:

`Syncs the browser across multiple devices so changes can be viewed in real time.`

### File Compression:

`Gulp compresses images and other assets to optimize load times.`
